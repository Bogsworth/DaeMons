# DaeMon Rough Outline

## Brainstorming
- Maybe use Tarot instead of sins
- Maybe add 7 virtues as well as 7 sins

### Moves
- More damage if you go first
- Increase the monID by 1
- Increase a moveID by 1
- Damage to uses as well as/instead of health, essentially milling

### Linux Daemon Ideas
 - Init
 - BioD
 - CronD
 - FingerD
 - SwapperD
 - SysLogD
 - SyncD
 - Reap Children as a move, normally killing a process's children but... it sounds terrible lol
