# DaeMon Rough Outline

## Brainstorming
- Maybe use Tarot instead of sins
- Maybe add 7 virtues as well as 7 sins
- A "Magicarp" that only sometimes turns into "gyardos" but sometimes turns into a worse magicarp

### Moves
- More damage if you go first
- Increase the monID by 1
- Increase a moveID by 1
- Damage to uses as well as/instead of health, essentially milling
- A move to create more, slightly weaker, mons in your empty party slot(s)
- Init as a move, maybe a self destruct that maximizes your next mon's attack, defense, speed, etc.?

### Linux Type
#### Daemon Ideas
- Init
- BioD
- CronD
- FingerD
- SwapperD
- SysLogD
- SyncD
- Reap Children as a move, normally killing a process's children but... it sounds terrible lol
#### Moves
- BlockChain
